        <p>Angular | TypeScript | Firebase</p>
        <span>Simple Hospitality CRM is a user-friendly Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system designed for property management, developed using Angular, TypeScript, and Firebase as the database. This system provides an efficient solution for managing various properties, bookings, and associated statistics.
          <br><br>
          Using Firebase Authentication, property owners can create access credentials for booking agents, enabling secure logins to the system. Once logged in, users are greeted with a clear and concise dashboard displaying key statistics, including property-specific income, booking volumes, and upcoming check-in and check-out dates for guests.
          <br><br>
          The core functionality of Simple Hospitality CRM is based on the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) principle. Users have the flexibility to create individual property listings, manage bookings by associating them with available properties, and update or delete records as needed. The system empowers property owners and booking agents to efficiently handle their hospitality business with a streamlined approach to data management.
          <br><br>
          Whether you're a property owner looking to manage bookings or a booking agent handling reservations, Simple Hospitality CRM simplifies the process, providing a comprehensive tool to organize, analyze, and optimize property-related data.</span>
